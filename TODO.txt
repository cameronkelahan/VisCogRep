OVERVIEW
- We decided on creating a Semantic Segmentation program
- We will then experiment on different architectures and pre-trained models across the coffee leaves dataset
- Our repo: https://github.com/cameronkelahan/VisCogRep
- Can reference Moodle for example paper outline; already have an Overleaf started: https://www.overleaf.com/project/65ae9ef7722999d2c270d234
- Example paper given by prof for semantic segmentation: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Yang_DenseASPP_for_Semantic_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf

TO-DO
1) Update ReadMe to include dataset download and clarification that it is meant to be run with GPU (easiest on colab)
